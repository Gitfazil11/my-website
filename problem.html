        <div class="text-lg text-gray-700 text-center">
          <p>Specific Problems
Human-Elephant Conflict: Roads cutting through elephant habitats lead to increased human-elephant conflict, with elephants entering farmlands for food and destroying crops. 
Habitat Fragmentation: Roads and other development projects fragment elephant habitats, disrupting their natural movements and increasing their proximity to human settlements. 
Risk to Drivers and Elephants: When elephants cross roads, they can be a hazard to drivers, leading to accidents that injure or kill both people and elephants. 
Elephant Aggression: Male elephants in a state of "musth" (a period of heightened aggression) are particularly dangerous and should be avoided at all costs. </p>
